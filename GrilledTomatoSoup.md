# Grilled tomato soup

### Ingredients
* A kilo of mixed tomatoes. Try to include a bunch of cherry tomatoes.
* Two whole garlics
* 1 Onion
* Basil
* 1L Broth
* Cooking cream

### Instruction
* Cut the top off the garlic and put them together with the tomatoes in an oven dish.
* Put them in the oven for 30-45 minutes and turn on the grill at the end. The tomatoes should shrivel and the garlic should be brown and soft.
* Let this cool
* Once cooled, squeeze the garlics like a ripe pimple.
* Cut up and saute an onion in a big pan
* Add the tomatoes + garlic
* Add the broth
* Let it simmer for 30 minutes
* Use the blender (can be nice to still have it chunky)
* Add the basil & little cream when serving
